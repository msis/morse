=================

Synopsis
--------

**morse** [-h] [-c] [--reverse-color] [-v] {create,rm,add,check,run,edit} ...

Description
-----------
MORSE, the Modular OpenRobots Simulation Engine, is a general-purpose robotics
simulator, primarily intended for an academic audience.

It relies on the Blender Game Engine to provide a semi-realistic 3D 
environment with physics simulation.

A robot and its environment are created in MORSE by building a model in
Blender. Actuator and sensor objects are attached to robot models, and may be
interacted with via a variety of middleware protocols. Simulations can be
programmed using Python scripts or inside of Blender itself. Currently supported
middleware includes YARP, MOOS, ROS, Pocolibs, Mavlink, HLA, PPRZLink, as well
as a plain socket interface.

Options
-------

These options apply to any MORSE command.

:-c, --color:
        Uses colors for MORSE output. The default color scheme is well
        adapted to terminals with a dark background.
:--reverse-color:
        Uses an alternate color theme for MORSE output, well adapted to
        terminals with a light background.
:-h, --help:
        Displays information regarding the program use.
:--version:
        Displays the version number.


Commands
--------

See "man morse-<command>" for a particular command's documentation.

:add:
        Adds templates for a new component (sensor, actuator, robot)
        to an existing simulation environment.
:check:
        Checks the environment is correctly setup to run morse.
:create:
        Creates a new simulation environment in a subdirectory of the
        current directory.
        A template simulation scene is also created.
        The environment is added to 'sites' in ~/.morse/config
:edit:
        Open the given Blender scene or Python script in the Blender
        interface for editing. The simulation can be started by 
        pressing P.
:import:
        Imports a pre-existing simulation as a new simulation environment.
:rm:
        Deletes an existing simulation environment.
:run:
        Runs a simulation (must be a Python script) without loading 
        the Blender interface.

Files
-----

Configuration files are stored in each user's $HOME/.morse directory.

:config:
        General MORSE configuration.
        The 'sites' section contains the list of simulation environments
        MORSE will look for at startup.

Environment
-----------

:MORSE_ROOT:
			Use this variable to determine where localised data is held. This
			variable must exist

:MORSE_BLENDER:
			Determine which Blender binary is used. If it does not exist, 
			rely on the first Blender in the PATH

:MORSE_RESOURCE_PATH:
			Determine where morse will search for Blender components. It is a
			colon-separated list of directories, similar to PATH. 

:MORSE_NODE:
			In multi-node mode, if no node name has been given, look for this
			variable to determine the name of the node. If it does not exist,
			use the hostname.

:MORSE_SILENT_PYTHON_CHECK:
			Do not restrict matching system vs. Blender Python version. Use at
			your own risk.

Since Morse relies on Python, at runtime Morse is affected by the standard
Python variables, in particular **PYTHONPATH**. See :manpage:`python(1)` for
details.
