Services tutorial :tag:`service` :tag:`socket`
==============================================

MORSE has a concept of services: services are remote procedure calls commonly
used to configure or control the simulation's behaviour.

This tutorial shows how to use these services. Different middlewares are
supported; refer to the :doc:`Middleware support in MORSE <../integration>`
(search requests in the :ref:`compatibility-matrix`).


Pre-requisites
--------------

- You must have completed the :doc:`first tutorial
  <../beginner_tutorials/tutorial>`.


Using the services
------------------

In order to use a service, you must know the exact name of this service, and
its parameters (You can refer to the component page, available :doc:`here
<../../../components_library>`).

Here is an example using a human component (the services available are
documented :doc:`here <../others/human>`).

Scene description
+++++++++++++++++

Let's start to describe the Morse scene. Here, the interesting part is that we
activate the service for human using the ``add_service`` method.

.. code-block:: python

	from morse.builder import *

	human = Human()
	human.add_service('socket')
	env = Environment('empty', fastmode=True)

Controlling the human with telnet
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now, let's see how we can control it using telnet::

    $ telnet localhost 4000
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.localdomain.
	Escape character is '^]'.
    > id1 human move [0.1, 0.0]
	id1 SUCCESS

where ``id1`` is the arbitrary id of the request, ``human`` is the name of the
used component, ``move`` and ``[0.1 ,0.0]`` are respectively the name of the
request and its parameters. This parameters must be in a JSON list.

Controlling the human with socket :tag:`socket`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here is a simple example of using services with sockets in Python (available at
``$MORSE_ROOT/tools/simple_exemple.py``):

.. code-block:: python

	import sys
	import socket
	import tty, termios

	HOST = '127.0.0.1'
	PORT = 4000

	def getchar():
		""" Returns a single character from standard input """

		fd = sys.stdin.fileno()
		old_settings = termios.tcgetattr(fd)
		try:
			tty.setraw(sys.stdin.fileno())
			ch = sys.stdin.read(1)
		finally:
			termios.tcsetattr(fd, termios.TCSADRAIN, old_settings)
		return ch


	def _connect_port(port):
		""" Establish the connection with the given MORSE port"""
		sock = None

		for res in socket.getaddrinfo(HOST, port, socket.AF_UNSPEC, socket.SOCK_STREAM):
			af, socktype, proto, canonname, sa = res
			try:
				sock = socket.socket(af, socktype, proto)
			except socket.error:
				sock = None
				continue
			try:
				sock.connect(sa)
			except socket.error:
				sock.close()
				sock = None
				continue
			break

		return sock

	def main():
		sock = _connect_port(PORT)
		if not sock:
			sys.exit(1)

		print("socket connected")
		print("Please press q to quit and use 8456 to move")
		esc = 0
		_id = 0

		while not esc:
			c = getchar()
			speed = 0
			rot = 0
			if (c == "8"):
				speed = 0.1
			elif (c == "5"):
				speed = -0.1
			elif (c == "4"):
				rot = 0.1
			elif (c == "6"):
				rot = -0.1
			if (speed != 0 or rot != 0):
				data_out = "id%d human move [%f, %f]\n" % (_id, speed, rot)
				sent = sock.send(data_out)
				print ("SENT DATA (%d bytes): %s" % (sent, data_out))
				_id = _id + 1

			if c == "q":
				esc = 1

		sock.close()
		print("\nBye bye!")

	main()


.. note::
  You can find a more complete example of a Python file using services to move
  the human here: ``$MORSE_ROOT/tools/wiimote_human_client.py``. (using wiimote
  to control the human)

Controlling the human with pymorse :tag:`pymorse`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The previous example can be rewritten more easily using the :doc:`pymorse API
<../../pymorse>`.

.. code-block:: python

	import sys
	import tty, termios
	from pymorse import Morse

	def getchar():
		""" Returns a single character from standard input """

		fd = sys.stdin.fileno()
		old_settings = termios.tcgetattr(fd)
		try:
			tty.setraw(sys.stdin.fileno())
			ch = sys.stdin.read(1)
		finally:
			termios.tcsetattr(fd, termios.TCSADRAIN, old_settings)
		return ch

	def main():
		with Morse()  as  morse:
			print("Please press q to quit and use 8456 to move")
			esc = 0

			while not esc:
				c = getchar()
				speed = 0
				rot = 0
				if (c == "8"):
					speed = 0.1
				elif (c == "5"):
					speed = -0.1
				elif (c == "4"):
					rot = 0.1
				elif (c == "6"):
					rot = -0.1
				if (speed != 0 or rot != 0):
					morse.rpc('human', 'move', speed, rot)

				if c == "q":
					esc = 1

			print("\nBye bye!")

	main()

  
Creating the Service
